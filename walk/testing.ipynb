      "age from the incident was estimated at €500,000 (US$637,000).[108] Throughout Germany, the storm wrought €60–100 million (US$80–130 million) in insured losses. A woman died in a traffic accident, attributed to wet road conditions, along the Bundesstraße 303 in the Bayreuth district.[109] Northwesterly gales yielded a storm surge along the country's North Sea coastline,[110] with tides running over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) above normal along the Elbe River at Hamburg. Neighboring Austria and Switzerland also experienced gales and power outages.[106] A tornado touched down near Neukirchen an der Enknach in Austria, damaging homes and farms.[111] Gusts in southern Switzerland reached 185 km/h (115 mph), leading to road and rail closures.[112] In southern France, the system initiated a mistral wind event.[106]\nThe upper-level low associated with the hurricane's remnants blanketed parts of the Alps with heavy snowfall, accumulating to several feet,[106] and subsequently fueled torrential rains in the Balkans on October 24 and 25. Floodwaters caused by estimated rainfall totals nearing 150 mm (6 in) inundated entire villages in southeastern Bulgaria, forcing hundreds to evacuate, and there were widespread disruptions of power and water services. A woman in Burgas died from drowning. In the Greek capital city of Athens, the deluge filled streets with rushing water that swept away hundreds of vehicles.[113][114] More than three hundred buildings were inundated in the Attica area.[115]\n\nSee also\n\n\nTropical cyclones portal\nOther storms of the same name\nList of Bermuda hurricanes\nList of Canada hurricanes\n1948 Bermuda–Newfoundland hurricane\nHurricane Luis devastated the Leeward Islands in 1995 before passing west of Bermuda.\nHurricane Georges (1998) caused extensive damage in Antigua and Barbuda.\nHurricane Fay (2014) made landfall on Bermuda just a week prior to Gonzalo.\nHurricanes Paulette and Teddy (2020) affected Bermuda within a week of each other.\nReferences\n\n\n^ \"Atlantic hurricane best track (HURDAT version 2)\" (Database).
